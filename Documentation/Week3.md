# Week 3

## What have I done this week?

- Refined the movement of the actual game
- Coded some of the more special moves of chess
- Got started on the graphical interface
- Made more tests

## How much progress have I made?

The chess engine part is almost complete. Most likely by next week.

## What did I learn?

I am learning how a turn-based game functions on java.

## Problems?

At this state I cannot properly test the new moves. I had less time to code than I wanted to.

## What is next?

Finish the engine. Perhaps build an initial bot. Make my own versions of data structures.
