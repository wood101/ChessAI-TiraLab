# Week 2

## What have I done this week?

-Coded an initialization of a chess board
-Coded almost all of the possible moves for the chess pieces
-Made a couple of tests

## How much progress have I made?

I think my progress is decent. Getting to the actual algorithms takes a while, because I would rather have a working chess engine first.

## What did I learn?

Learned to code possible movement options for the chess pieces. I did it without using a 2d array, which proved interesting.

## Problems?

The game doesn't fuction quite yet, but it will soon.

## What is next?

Getting a graphical interface done and an interactable game. Initial plan is to build a bot that makes random moves to play against.
