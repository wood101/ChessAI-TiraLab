# Week 6

## What have I done this week?

- Fixed the rest of the bugs I had found
- Implemented stalemate check for board repetition
- Removed HashMap usage since it was unnecessary
- Improved test coverage
- Added variety to bot vs. bot games

## How much progress have I made?

The game is done.

## What did I learn?

Learned to get rid of HashMap, when it is not needed.

## Problems?

Bot vs. bot games are slower after adding board repetition checking.

## What is next?

Everything else is extra. Might improve the UI a bit and try to speed up bot vs. bot games. Possibly improve the heuristic for Minimax.
