# Week 4

## What have I done this week?

- More bug fixing
- The game can end
- Implemented the AI with Minimax
- Added to the test documentation

## How much progress have I made?

The engine is almost fully operational, two human players can play a regular game of chess. AI is in working order, but gets stuck in a loop since board repetition is not done yet.

## What did I learn?

Learned to implement the minimax algorithm to a chess game. 

## Problems?

Nothing in particular.

## What is next?

More tests, better evaluation for the algorithm, stalemate due to board state repetition. Improvements to the UI. My own hashmap.
